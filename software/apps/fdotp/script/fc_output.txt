ARGUMENTS
       file_list
              Specifies  a  list of SAIF files to be read. Each list item con-
              sists of the SAIF file name and optionally the  weight,  scaling
              ratio,  strip  path, and the path. The syntax for each list item
              is
                file_name
                   [-weight weight_value]
                   [-scaling_ratio scaling_ratio_value]
                   [-strip_path source_name]
                   [-path target_name]

              The default for the -weight and -scaling_ratio  options  is  1.0
              and when specified must be larger than 0.0.  The -strip_path and
              -path options can be specified either individually for each file
              or  once  for  all  the  files when multiple files have the same
              strip path or path.

       -strip_path source_name
              Specifies the name of the instance of the current design  as  it
              appears  in  the  SAIF  file.   The current design appears as an
              instance in the SAIF file.  The read_saif command annotates  all
              subinstances  in  the  hierarchy  of the specified instance, and
              annotates the instance itself.  Each instance name that is spec-
              ified must be complete, but without any trailing hierarchy sepa-
              rator (/).

       -path target_name
              Specifies the target instance on which the switching activity in
              the SAIF file is to be annotated.  If this option not specified,
              the current instance is assumed to be the target instance.

       -scenarios scenario_list
              Specifies the scenarios to be considered.  If this option is not
              specified,  then  only those scenarios are considered which con-
              tain the modes and corners specified through -modes and -corners
              options.   Activity  annotation is done separately for each sce-
              nario.  If none of the -modes, -corners, or  -scenarios  options
              are  specified,  annotation  is done for the current scenario in
              the design.

       -modes mode_list
              Specifies the mode filter on the set of scenarios to be  consid-
              ered.   A  scenario  is  considered  if  its  mode is present in
              mode_list. If this option is not specified, no filtering  occurs
              on modes.

       -corners corner_list
              Specifies  the  corner filter on the set of scenarios to be con-
              sidered.  A scenario is considered if its corner is  present  in
              corner_list.  If  this  option  is  not  specified, no filtering
              occurs on corners.

       -exclude_sdpd
              When specified, the state-dependent  and  path-dependent  (SDPD)
              switching  activities  are ignored while reading saif files.  By
              default, the SDPD activities are read from saif files.

       -normalize true | false
              Controls whether the weight associated with each  SAIF  file  is
              normalized,  which  means  that the sum of the weighted activity
              values is divided by the sum of the weights.

              By default (true), the command normalizes the weights.

              If the value is false, the command uses the  weights  as  speci-
              fied.

       -nocase
              When specified, the SAIF file is matched without considering the
              name case of the objects specified.  The object matching is done
              in name-case insensitive manner.

       -report
              When  specified, the command generates a summary which indicates
              number of objects present in saif file which were found  in  the
              design  and  also number of objects present in design which were
              found in the saif file.  If this option is not  specified,  com-
              mand summary is not generated.

       -use_highest_toggle_rate
              When this option is used, the non-SDPD activity with the highest
              toggle rate is selected from the list of specified  SAIF  files.
              When this option is specified, SDPD activities are ignored. This
              option cannot be used with the option normalize and weight.

       -derate_glitch derate_value
              Specifies the default derate glitch value to be used if no  der-
              ate glitch is specified in SAIF file.

       -ignore_name_mapping
              Reads  a  SAIF  file  generated from the current design where no
              name mapping needs to be performed. For example, when reading  a
              gate  level  SAIF  file  generated  from  the same netlist. This
              allows the existing name mapping database to  be  preserved  but
              not used for the read_saif command.

DESCRIPTION
       The  read_saif  command  reads  a  list of SAIF files and annotates the
       switching activity attributes rise_toggle_rate,  fall_toggle_rate,  and
       static_probability for nets, ports, and pins of the current design.  If
       a particular object in the SAIF file cannot be  found  in  the  current
       design,  the  object is ignored and a warning message is provided.  The
       read_saif command returns 1 if at least one of the objects in the  file
       is  successfully  annotated.  Otherwise,  it  returns  0.  This command
       resets the switching activity for the design before reading the  speci-
       fied  SAIF files. For merging of SAIF files, one can read multiple SAIF
       files. The probabilities are multiplied  with  the  weight  factor  and
       accumulated  overall  SAIF  files. The toggle rates are multiplied with
       the weight factor and the scaling factor and accumulated over all  SAIF
       files.   The  resulting  probability  and  toggle  rate  is  normalized
       (divided by the sum of weights), except when option -normalize false is
       used.

       Whenever  the  -nocase  option  is  used,  the SAIF file is interpreted
       ignoring the name cases of the  objects  specified  in  SAIF  file.  An
       object  with  name  'ABC' in SAIF can be matched to object 'abc' in the
       netlist and vice-versa.

       SAIF information is saved with a block unless  the  application  option
       power.enable_activity_persistency is set to off.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  annotates  switching  activity for the current
       block.

         prompt> read_saif test.saif

       The following example annotates  switching  activity  for  the  current
       block that has been annotated as Test/U1 in simulation testbench.

         prompt> read_saif test.saif -strip_path Test/U1

       The  following  example annotates switching activity from the SAIF file
       for the instance Mult/U12 in the current block.

         prompt> read_saif test.saif -path Mult/U12

       The following example annotates the switching activity from a SAIF file
       and then reports it using the get_switching_activity command.  The tog-
       gle rate values and static probability are derived from the  SAIF  file
       and the activity type is set to 'simulated'.

         prompt> read_saif test1.saif
         prompt> get_switching_activity [get_pins GPRs/iso]
         (mode = default, corner = default, probability = 0.504926,
         rise_toggle_rate = 9.61391e+06, fall_toggle_rate = 9.61391e+06,
         type = simulated)

       The  following example merges two SAIF files test1.saif and test2.saif.
       The  probabilities  for  the  annotated  cells  are  (1   *   probabil-
       ity(test1.saif)  +  2  *  probability(test2.saif))  / 3, and the toggle
       rates  are  ((1  *  4  *  toggle_rate(test1.saif)  +   2   *   3   tog-
       gle_rate(test2.saif))  / 3.  Since individual strip paths have not been
       specified  per  file,  strip  path  for  both  are  ChipTop.  Path  for
       test1.saif file is InstDecode, and for test2.saif file is GPRs.

         prompt> read_saif {{test1.saif -scaling_ratio 4 -path InstDecode} \
            {test2.saif -weight 2.0 -scaling_ratio 3.0}} \
            -strip_path ChipTop -path GPRs

       The  following  example merges two SAIF files test1.saif and test2.saif
       under the option use_highest_toggle_rate. The non-SDPD toggle rate  and
       probabilities for the annotated cells are chosen to be those of the one
       with highest toggle rate amongst test1.saif and test2.saif.  When  this
       option is specified, SDPD activities are ignored.

         prompt> read_saif -use_highest_toggle_rate {{test1.saif} {test2.saif}}
